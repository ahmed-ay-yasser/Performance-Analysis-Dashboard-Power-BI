# Performance Analysis Dashboard 

### Project Description
The project aims at creating a complete informative & interactive dashboard using Power BI desktop. The work was a part of an online three-hour workshop session about creating dashboards in Power BI on Zoom.

### About the Data
The dataset used for this project was about "Cars Company". It consists of 700 rows and 14 columns in a Xlsx file.

### Project Process
To begin the project, the Excel file was imported to the Power BI environment and some transformations to the data were performed. Then, we chose the dark blue color as the main color for the dashboard as it seems to be professional and more popular. 
- We analyzed the data to extract meaningful conclusions such as the total sales price, cost, labor and, so on.
- We looked at different variables according to the sale price such as model, make and, vehicle type.
- Also, we shed the light on the change of sales price over time.
- Finally, we sorted the clients' names according to the sales price from highest to lowest in addition to the percentage out of total.
